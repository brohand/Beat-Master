Welcome to Master Beat, the ultimate in off-sync rhythm games.
Will you surpass the Beat Master? I sure hope so fam.

HOW TO PLAY:
Press the face and trigger buttons in time to the falling notes (when they hit the middle of the hollow square).
Don't miss too much, or you'll game over.

CONTROLS:
Leftmost notes: L Button
Second Leftmost notes: A Button
Second RIghtmost notes: B Button
Rightmost notes: R Button

Das it man


****WARNING*****
There might be a really long pause after the "last" note, but don't worry, there is one more note. Hit that (or tank it)
and you should reach the win screen. This isn't a glitch, but the beatmap may or may not be finished at the time of submission.
